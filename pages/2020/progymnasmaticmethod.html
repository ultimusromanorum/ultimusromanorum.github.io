	 <h2>On the Progymnasmatic Method</h2>
<main>
<p>
Throughout history, there were many methods by which one could develop an aptitude for writing. In late history, however, we were inundated with heaps of books on the subject of composition, and reams of paper, as our scowling teachers urged us to write stories and tales on our blank sheets. But, I believe that one does not need the new bestseller to write elegantly, or even correctly. What one needs is a method and a sense of logic. This is where the Progymnasmata, that famous yet forgotten catalogue of texts comes in to help us. Beginning with Aesop, the student copies the entire text of the fable onto his notebook. Then, he abstracts the particulars of the story into a division of three parts, or acts. With this skeleton of the fable, the student begins to write the fable in his own peculiar style. Et voil√°, the student has written his own fable. But this is only the first stage of the progymnasmata. The second stage is concerned with the writing of narratives. The narrative is not much different from the fable. But whereas the fable has the moral, the narrative has the questions of who did what, and when, and how and so forth. Thus, as the ancient rhetoricians said, the chief concern of the narrative is to relate a story as if it did indeed happen, whether that is true or not. The succeeding stages of the progymnasmata are many, and I shall enumerate them here for the sake of simplicity. They are, in order, chreia, gnome, anaskeue, kataskeue, topos, enkomion, psogos, synkrisis, ethopoiia, ekphrasis, thesis, and the introduction of a law. All of these stages have something for someone. Chreia, for example, would be interesting to a raconteur, and kataskeue to a withering curmudgeon. All of these stages, however, contain one fundament for writing. In our works and the works of others, we can find almost any element from the progymnasmata. You name it, description (ekphrasis), maxim (gnome), refutation (anaskeue). The same method oulined before must be applied to the succeeding stages. Read, copy, divide, write. And as for developing your sense of logic, the short way of going about it is keeping the principle of non-contradiction in your mind whenever you write. Many missteps in usage can be avoided if we simply apply this principle carefully and intelligently. Concluding this, I will recapitulate my point. If you want to write in an elegant manner, read a great author and try to imitate his style. Or in other words, become great by using the progymnasmatic method.
