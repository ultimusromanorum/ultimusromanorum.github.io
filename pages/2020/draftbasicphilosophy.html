<h2>Draft of Basic Philosophy</h2>

Every activity ends in a thing perceived to be good by the doer. As breadmakers view the production of bread the chief good of their craft, and as chemists view the knowledge of chemical substances the chief good of their science, so too do philosophers have their goal. But before one determines the goal of philosophy, one must outline a method of doing so. Whenever anything is to be examined, we must answer these four questions: first, does the thing exist; second, what is the nature of the thing; third; what sort of being is the thing; and fourth, what is the purpose of the thing.</p>

We affirm the existence of philosophy against skeptics. The matter is clear to anyone who thinks they possess knowledge, and so the need for arguments against skepticism is not great.</p>

The next step to consider is the definition of philosophy. A definition is a precise statement of a thing’s nature. It does not concern itself with accidents and likewise no prolixity is given room. The word ‘nature’, however, is likely to set off the wrong impression in our modern audience. The intended meaning of the word is not the corporeal realm of everyday science. But rather it is the essence of a thing, or in plain English: whatness.</p>

Now, the definition of philosophy may come from either its subject matter or goal. The subject matter may either be universal or particular, and its goal may either be remote or proximate.</p>
