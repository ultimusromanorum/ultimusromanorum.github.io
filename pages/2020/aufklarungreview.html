	 <h2>Summary: Immanuel Kant – What is Enlightenment (1784)</h2>
<main>
<p>Published first in the journal Berlinische Monatsschrift (Berlin Monthly) on 12 December 1784, Kant’s essay entitled ‘Was ist Aufklärung?‘ was an attempt at answering Reverend Zöllner’s question of what enlightenment exactly is in his essay ‘Is it advisable to sanction marriage through religion?’ (1783) where the full passage of where the question appears goes as follows:
<br>
What is Enlightenment? The question, which is almost as important as the question ‘What is truth?’, should be answered before one begins to enlighten others. And yet I have never found it answered anywhere.’
<br>
Kant took a notice of this question posed by Rev. Zöllner, and decided to answer it with a short and often cited meaning of enlightenment where it is defined as ‘The emergence of man from self-incurred immaturity’ with an added definition of immaturity which reads ‘Immaturity is the inability to use one’s own understanding without the guidance of another’. The motto of this process is ‘Sapere Aude!’ which translates to ‘Dare to be wise!’. Following this, Kant continues to describe the nature of this state of immaturity and how it is maintained. Even after they have come of age by virtue of their nature and that thus they have been emancipated from alien guidance through this act, they still cling to their immaturity because of their laziness and cowardice. The men are very much comfortable in remaining in this state, because they have become used to this kind of life and consider it convenient and safe since their guides will always be there to help them.
<br>
Additionally, there is another reason for why men might fear liberation from immaturity. It is when they have become less independent on the mechanical dogmas and formulas of life for which they have relied upon for so long, and that the prolonged usage of these instruments made them weak in the exercise of their own understanding, thus they will feel wobbly when they attempt to walk freely given that they are unaccustomed to this activity.
<br>
How might we free ourselves from this immaturity? For a start, this attainment must be slow, since it can only be brought about if the public were given freedom, and it cannot be provided by a revolutionary act, for a people’s form of thinking cannot be transformed into a free one because a revolution will instead replace the old prejudices with new ones and thus no true freedom in thought will be gained.
<br>
Private use of one’s own reason is the one which doesn’t hinder progress but may hinder the continuation of an institution if done maliciously. A citizen who uses private reason in front of the taxman to criticise the fiscal measures he must obey would lead to a situation where the citizen is rebellious and stops the continuous unity of the mechanism which he is putting under scrutiny. Likewise, a soldier who quibbles about the usefulness or appropriateness of the order he was just given can impede the actualisation of the public ends which the mechanism he works for was established to complete.
<br>
One objection to the exercise of reason might lie in the existence of immutable religious dogmas which we are not allowed to question, especially if they are ratified by the supreme power or legislation. However, to deny the right for humanity to correct and expand its knowledge would be to stomp on the sacred rights of mankind, and it would mean to deny that the very nature of mankind lies in this kind of progress.
<br>
Even if so, whenever a particular measure is trying to be turned into a law, we may ask, whether the people themselves would be able to impose such a law on themselves? In this case, it is not so, for the later generations with regard to the one that put this law may freely view this measure as absolutely null and void.
<br>
People in the 1700s did not live in an enlightened age, according to Kant, but put more correctly, they lived in an Age of Enlightenment where there were fewer and fewer obstacles to the way towards this maturity. Kant also alludes to Frederick II when he mentions the removal of obstacles towards the path of maturity.
<br>
Men will of their own accord free themselves from the shackles of barbarism if they are left to their own devices, as a kind and enlightened prince would do if he was the face of government in his own nation. This ruler deserves to be praised if he is the originator of this process, both by the present and posterity. Ecclesiastical authorities should also be free to express their own verdicts and opinions under this state, even if they might deviate from orthodox doctrine.
<br>
The need for focusing on matters of religion lies in two facts, the first that leaders throughout history haven’t given much concern for the arts and sciences as they did for religion, and second is that religious immaturity is the most pernicious and undesirable of all varieties of immaturity. The mind of a leader who also allows freedom in the arts and sciences is further extended as well, since he realises that there is no real danger to his legislation if he does so.
<br>
Concluding this summary, Kant builds upon the previous statements and says that the freedom to publicly reason will also eventually influence the principle of governments (since the enlightenment spreads slowly through vocal and well-cultivated minds), and that because of this man will be treated less like a machine (as did the materialists consider man to be) and more in-line with his true dignity. Kant’s view of enlightenment is that it is essentially an emergence of man’s from self-incurred immaturity whereby he attained this status through clinging on to his old guardians which informed his understanding and where he can only be freed if he himself stands on his own two feet and freely exercises his ability to use public reason.</p>
