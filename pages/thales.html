	<h3>LIFE OF THALES</h3>
	<img src="/styles/thales.jpg" alt="A Picture of Thales">
	<p>Thales (Θαλῆς) was born in Miletus during the 35th Olympiad in the year 640 BCE. His parents, Examuas and Cleobuline, reputedly belonged to the Phoenician family of Thelides, a group of people who were said to be the descendants of Cadmus and Agenor. Although there were a few writers, such as Herodotus and Democritus, who stated that Thales was of Phoenician extraction, the majority of ancient scholars held that he was of purely Ionian ancestry. Those who held that he was a Phoenician said that he became a Milesian citizen along with Neileus, who was exiled from Phoenicia. Among the many ancient philosophers who admired him include figures such as Xenophanes, Heraclitus and Democritus. He is traditionally placed in the ranks of the seven sages and he was especially praised for his theoretical efforts in astronomy.</p>

	<p>Thales reportedly traveled to Egypt in his youth, particularly to the cities of Memphis and Thebes, to study with the learned priests there. He was said to have recommended Pythagoras to make the same trip. He was first called a sage about 582 BCE while Damasius was archon. He successfully predicted a solar eclipse on the day the Lydian king Alyattes and Median king Cyaxares fought each other – May 28th 585 BCE.</p>

	<p>There are several stories of Thales’ political activities. The first is that he suggested that a single council should be established at Teos, a city located smack-dab in Ionia, and have all the other towns be nothing more than demes. He also saved Milesus from the destructive armies of Cyrus by preventing the Ionian government from making an alliance with Croesus, whose kingdom was later conquered by Cyrus. The relationship between Croesus and Thales was not as sour as this story seems to indicate – for he also dug a deep canal in the shape of a crescent in the river Halys as a way of helping Croesus’ army to cross.</p>

	<p>Regarding his own way of life, he was said to be a solitudinous and private person. He either had a son named Cybisthus or he adopted his nephew. He clearly had a disposition towards contemplation, as the following story seems to indicate. Thales, whilst intensely observing into a sky, tripped and fell into a well. A Thracian woman saw him in there and laughingly remarked of how while he was eager to look at the sky, he couldn’t see what was in front of hin or at his feet. Aristoteles called such contemplative men wise but not prudent, because while they busied themselves with what is difficult and divine, they failed to pursue what is advantageous for them. But Aristoteles, in another work, relates a story that presents a different picture of Thales. When Thales was reproached for being poor and was told philosophy is useless, he predicted during the winter that there will be a huge crop of olives in the summer. So, he bought many olive-presses in Miletus and Chios for cheap. Summer eventually came and he sold all those olives for a very high price. Aristoteles, after relating this story, says that philosophers could easily become rich if they wished so, but it is not riches they are after.</p>

	<p>He apparently composed many songs. One song says that many words do not make a reasonable opinion and that one should search for the wise and choose the good so as to avoid the incessant chatter of men. There are many stories where he answers a question with a quip. When asked why he doesn’t have any children, he said it was because he loved them. He told his mother “It is not the right time yet” when she asked him about marriage, and when he became old he said “It is no longer the right time”. He was grateful for being born as a Greek man instead of an animal, woman or barbarian. He said that God, the World, Place, Mind, and Time is the oldest, most beautiful, biggest, fastest, and wisest, respectively. He stated there is no difference between life and death, and when someone asked why doesn’t he die, he answered it’s because there is no difference. When asked which came earlier – Night or Day – he answered the Night was earlier by a day. Regarding ethical matters, he said one could not escape the notice of the gods after committing injustice even if one intends to do so, and that to commit perjury is worse than simply admitting to adultery. He said to know oneself is difficult, to advise easy, to have success pleasant, to be divine is to be without a beginning or an end and that the rarest thing he saw was an old tyrant. Furthermore, he claimed that seeing our enemies in plight makes our own pain more bearable, that to live justly and happily is to avoid the things we blame others for and to have a healthy body as well as a resourceful spirit. He also comments on social ethics: he says we should remember our friends, avoid using dishonest means to get rich and expect the same favors from our children as we’ve given to our parents. He was particularly concerned about dissimulation when he advised not to let an utterance set us against those whom we trust and that we should be beautiful in what we do instead of merely beautifying our appearance. When Mandrolytus of Priene offered Thales to set the price for teaching him to calculate the sun’s orbit, Thales said that simply attributing this discovery to himself instead of anyone else would be enough.</p>

	<p>Thales lived to about either 78 or 90 years old. He died during the 50th Olympiad in 548 BCE while watching an athletic contest. Lobon reports an inscription on a statue which calls Thales: “the most venerable of all astronomers in wisdom”.</p>
	
	<h3>REVIEW</h3>
	<p>Thales apparently never composed any philosophical treatise. There are several titles that were attributed to him in antiquity, but it is unlikely that he actually composed any of them. They include, in no particular order: Nautical Astronomy, On the Solstice, On the Equinox, and On the Principles. Lobon of Argos estimated that Thales wrote around 200 lines of text on astronomy. The chief principle of his cosmology is the claim that the world is made up of water (hudôr). He thought that water is the beginning and end of all things, for it is because of water that earthquakes happen, the winds blow and the stars move. One pseudepigraphic text by Thales entitled On the Principles states how water is merely the first of the four elements and that all four mix with each other.

	<p>Thales believed that there is only one world. The stars, according to him, are made of earth that is on fire. As regards the planet Earth, he said it rests upon water similarly to a piece of wood that floats upon a river. This explains the occurrence of earthquakes — they are caused by the Earth’s mobility given to it by its resting on water. Thales also tried to explain why the Etesian winds raise the bulk of the Nile and he did so by saying its outflow is driven back by the swelling of the Mediterrenean Sea.

	<p>Aristoteles reports that he said all things are full of gods and that he believed magnets possessed souls on account of their capacity for moving iron. This zany conclusion becomes a little more reasonable once it is understood that he considered motion to be the essential activity of the soul. Hippias says that he thought amber has a soul as well.

	<p>Besides engaging in philosophy, he also came up with many things in astronomy and geometry. The following discoveries were attributed to him in antiquity: the armillary sphere, trajectory between the tropics, prediction of solstices and eclipses, procession of the seasons, division of the year into 365 days, discovery of the Great Bear constellation, geocentrism, that the angles of two intersecting straight lines are equal, that the angles at the base of every isosceles triangle are equal, that one could prove the congruence of two triangles whose side and nearby angles are equal, measurement of the height of the Pyramids at Giza, yearly reversion of the sun, that the size of the sun is the 720th part of the solar circle, division of the starry sky into five circles, that the Sun’s revolutions are unequally periodical, and that there are two Hyades – one in the north and the other in the south.</p>

	<p>There is a tendency in ancient literature to trace scientific discoveries back to Thales. As a result of this, we sometimes have contrary accounts of who came up with what. Firstly, we repory which says that Thales discovered that the sun illuminates the moon, but it is actually Parmenides of Elea who made this discovery. Next, we have an account where Thales sacrificed a bull after he ascribed a right triangle in a circle, but some historians replace the name of Thales with that of Pythagoras.</p>

	<p>Aristoteles, seemingly not knowing how Thales came to this doctrine, speculates that he came to the conclusion about water as the first principle by observing that all living things, such as seeds, are moist. Aristoteles further comments on how some supposed that this view is actually present in ancient poetry by pointing out the Styx being the oath of the gods, and the role Oceanus plays in mythology.</p>

	<p>Aristoteles goes on to investigate the proposition regarding the divinity of all things. His guess was that Thales thought this because the soul is mixed in with the whole world, which is animate. The view Thales had of the view was that it is an immortal and self-moving entity.</p>

	<p>Thales was believed to have remarked that God is the intellect of the cosmos and that it is God who is capable of making all things out of water. The cause of movement within the water that surrounds the world, according to him, is the dwelling of the great divine spirit. His prodigious talent for geometry was said to have helped him surmise that there is only one creator of the world.</p>

	<p>The later reception of Thales by the gnostics in late antiquity is admittedly interesting: Irenaeus reports that for them the “Water” of Thales and the “Bythos” (or, Abyss) of the Gnostics are identical. Another heresiologist, St. Hippolytus, says that the gnostics thought the serpent is the moist substance without which nothing can be formed. Minucius Felix was quite impressed by the doctrines of Thales and claimed that he might have received divine inspiration when he formulated them.</p>
