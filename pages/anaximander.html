	<h3>LIFE OF Anaximandros</h3>
	<p>Anaximandros (Ἀναξίμανδρος), son of Praxiades, was born in 610 BCE in the city of Miletus in Ionia. Anaximandros is the first person to have authored a philosophical treatise in Greek prose. His chief work is called “On Nature”. We know from the Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, that there were other books which were attributed to him, but it is more probable that these books were simply parts of "On Nature" rather than separate, distinct works. The catalogue of Anaximandros's oeuvre is the following: (a) On Nature; (b) Map of the Earth; (c) On the Fixed Stars; (d) The Sphere. 

	Anaximandros, as the titles of the works given above seem to indicate, was a geographer. Indeed, he, along with Hecataeus of Miletus, was among the earliest of the Greeks who was said to have conducted research in geography. Anaximandros, as part of his geographical research, drew a map of the world and built a celestial sphere.

	He, like Thales, was also a politically active citizen of Miletus. He helped to establish a colony at the city of Apollonia on the shores of the Black Sea.

	On one occasion, while he was in Lacedaemonia, he warned the local citizens about an imminent earthquake and told them to sleep in the fields fully armed. The earthquake eventually came, and in addition to destroying the city of Sparta, it broke the peak of Mount Taygetus.

	As regards Anaximandros's personality, he was seemingly very peculiar in his outward appearance. Diodorus of Ephesus said that Empedocles, a fellow philosopher living in the 5th century, imitated Anaximandros's demeanor by cultivating a theatrical pomp and wearing showy attire. There was in addition to this an incident where children, on one occasion, made fun of Anaximandros's singing, and upon hearing their jibes, Anaximandros promised to himself that he should sing better for the sake of the children.

	Anaximandros died at the age of 64 in 547 BCE. There is a tendentious claim found in Diogenes Laertius regarding when he lived. This date which was supposedly calculated by Apollodorus of Athens appears to be wrong because it states that Anaximandros flourished during the reign of Polycrates, a Greek tyrant who ruled the island of Samos between 538 BCE and 522 BCE. This assertion is very likely wrong, because Anaximandros could not have reached his maturity during the reign of Polycrates if he was 64 years old in the 58th Olympiad, i.e. 548-544 BCE.</p>

	<h3>REVIEW</h3>
	<p>The chief peculiarity of Anaximandros’s philosophy is an emphasis on the concept of "unlimited". The original Greek form of the term is "το ἀπείρων", which literally translates to “without any boundary or limit". The Greek form of the term is a combination of two words: the affix "ἀ" which typically designates privation or absence, and the Ionic form of "πεῖραρ" — πέρας — which stands for "extremity" or "border". Here's an example of its regular use from Homer's Iliad:
	<p>"Nor do I trouble myself about your anger, not even if you should go to the nethermost *bounds* of earth and sea, where Iapetus and Cronos sit and have joy neither in the rays of Helios Hyperion nor in any breeze, but deep Tartarus is round about them." 
	Homer — Ilias, VIII.478	</p>
	<p>The term "το ἀπείρων" also carries with it a deeper meaning with respect to its application. The term not only suggests the notion of boundlessness in space, as its English equivalent seems to imply, but it also affirms infinitude in time as well; since "πέρας" can also mean "end", "conclusion", or "termination". Anaximandros, therefore, says "το ἀπείρων" is unaging. It is without any beginning and end, and therefore it surrounds all worlds. Moreover, it steers all things, and thus Anaximandros can rightfully be called to be a believer in divine providence. It is through this principle (άρχή) that all things are born and destroyed. This process of generation and corruption is described by Anaximandros to be like that of fate or destiny (χρεών) where the elements pay the penalty (δίκη) and recompense (τίσις) to each other for their injustice (άδίκη) according to the arrangement (τάξις) of time (χρόνος). This particular statement is difficult to understand, as it's in fact the only verbatim fragment we have from Anaximandros's works, so we will try to elucidate it a little by pointing out the significance of the Greek terms employed here. Now, the first part of the statement, which states that the process of creation and destruction is akin to "fate" or "destiny", means that this phenomenon is similar to a situation in which one is obliged to do something, and thus the word "χρεών" can also be translated as "necessity". Next, the words "δίκη" and "άδίκη" are obviously related to the name of the Greek goddess of justice: Dike. The word "χρόνος" denotes the passing of time. The last two words, namely "τίσις" and "τάξις", possess a particularly interesting meaning which is not clearly understood in the English translation. The former means "payment", "recompense", "punishment" or "expiation" — the fulfillment of justice, in other words. The latter is often used to describe the arrangement of a particular military unit, and it is from this term that we get the word "syntax".

	The other parts of Anaximandros's "On Nature" were apparently concerned with natural subjects such as cosmology, meteorology. and zoology. Anaximandros claimed that there is an eternal motion in the universe. Whether this pronouncement refers to Thales' "great divine spirit" which moves through the world is open to interpretation.

	Contrary to Thales, he believed that the Earth rests upon nothing and remains suspended because it is equally distant from everything in the universe. The shape of the Earth, according to Anaximandros, is curved, round and reminiscent of the smoothness of a stone column. The stars are like wheels of fire surrounded by air. The stars are, moreover, separated from the cosmic fire that pervades the entire universe. Furthermore, there are aulos-shaped orifices through which the light of the stars appears, and it is said that eclipses happen when these passages are obstructed. The waxing and waning of the moon is likewise explained by this hypothesis.

	There is a certain passage concerning the size of the sun, moon, and the stars that seems to be missing a few phrases. Hermann Diels thought that this passage, which is found in the <i>Refutatio Omnium Haeresium</i> of St. Hippolytus, was especially lacunose, and so he decided to emendate the text. As it stands, the passage states that Anaximandros believed the circle of the sun to be 27 times larger than the moon and that the sun occupies the highest position in the heavens with the moon being next and the fixed stars coming last. Diels corrects this to say that the sun is 27 times larger than the Earth, that the sun is 19 times larger than the moon and that the planets occupy the lowest position in the heavens after the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars, respectively.

	Another, seemingly bizarre, set of doctrines espoused by Anaximandros concerns the notion of world. Anaximandros supposed that there are innumerable worlds out there, some of which are eternally being born and others perpetually perishing. All of these worlds are said to come out of the unlimited substance. They are equally distant from each other. They are also destructible, as they are destroyed when they return to the unlimited substance from which they have sprung out of. Anaximandros gives this doctrine a theological interpretation by supposing that these infinite worlds are gods. But since these worlds are born, it follows that the gods are also born if they are to be identified with these worlds. Anaximandros said the gods sometimes appear and disappear at long intervals. Cicero, a magnificent orator and associate of Julius Caesar, spurned this theory about the gods with ridicule.

	Anaximandros was an able investigator in the field of biology. In fact, the first outlines of the theory of evolution are found in the testimonia about him and his ideas. The way in which animals are generated, he says, is through the evaporation caused by the sun. In the beginning, humans were similar to fish-like beings. This ancient supposition squares nicely with the modern discovery of tetrapodomorpha in the Carboniferous Period.

	According to Anaximandros, when winds get caught in a thick cloud but then break out violently by reason of their fineness and lightness, the tearing causes the noise, and the cracking, against the blackness of the cloud, causes the flash. The clouds start to pour rain after the sun affects them.</p>
