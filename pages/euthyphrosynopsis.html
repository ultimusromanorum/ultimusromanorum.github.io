	<h2>Synopsis â€” Euthyphro</h2>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;">Year: 399 BCE</h3>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Place: the Agora in Athens </h3>
	<p>Euthyphro and Socrates appear before the Stoa of King Archon in order to attend their respective trials. Euthyphro is the prosecutor in his case while Socrates is on the defensive side. Euthyphro is surprised to see Socrates there because his usual haunting place was in the Lyceum in the eastern outskirts of the city. Socrates asks Euthyphro whom he is asking prosecuting and he replies he is accusing his father of murder. Euthyphro proceeds to give a short account of what happened: as one of his laborers was working on his farm in Naxos, the worker got drunk and cut the throat of another worker. Euthyphro's father tied up the man and left him to die of exposure. Euthyphro claims that prosecuting a guilty man, whether he is his kin or not, is a holy thing to do. Socrates then asks him what he considers holiness to be and Euthyphro answers that 'prosecuting and punishing wrong-doers, e.g. those who kill unjustly or steal sacred artifacts'. Socrates then asks for a singular characteristic of the holy and Euthyphro says it is 'whatever the gods love'. Euthyphro amends that definition to 'whatever all the gods love' after Socrates brings the many feuds of the gods to his attention. Socrates then proceeds to pose the famous question 'is something holy because it is loved by the gods or do the gods love what is holy because it is holy'? Euthyphro picks the former option and Socrates then responds with an analogy between various of examples of an activity and a state of carrying, e.g. being carried is not prior to the actual act of carrying. The two continue to quibble about this point until they realise they've argued in a circle and Euthyphro says he must hurry to his trial. The dialogue ends here.</p>
