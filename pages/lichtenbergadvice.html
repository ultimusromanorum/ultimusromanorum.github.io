	  <h1>Excellent Bits of Advice from Georg Lichtenberg</h1>
<main>
<p>To profitably read the Scrapbooks of Lichtenberg is an easy thing to do. The very nature of aphoristic writing allows one to discover new paths and problems by which one could discover the truth, and sometimes, aphorisms may provide the method even. This occurs often in the pithy statements which I have culled from Lichtenberg. As such, much can be gained from taking these procedures to heart and applying them in one's life. I hope you enjoy the ingenious bits I have scraped from his "Wastebooks."

- Avail yourself of new conjectures, which appear reasonable, to stimulate your mind.

- Ask yourself: quid, quis, ubi (i.e. what, who, where)

- Upon hearing a claim, ask the following: IS THIS TRUE? Answer the question and then provide a reason for it.

- Take a particular system and then remove some of its members to see how the whole behaves in that case.

- Ask yourself: Can I explain the insignificant details of a given system?

- To read judiciously, remember what is said and unite it with your own system of thought, and appropriate for yourself how others have previously understood the matter.

- Whenever you observe difficulties or gaps in your thinking, read a good book.

- Be attentive, experience nothing in vain, measure and compare - this is the entire law of philosophy.

- Whatever one sees, does or reads should be cloaked with such a degree of clarity as to be able to resist the most general objections.

- The aforementioned "general objections" should be added to the structure of our system, which ought not to contain any disputable propositions.

- If our structure of thought contains disputable premises, we ought to reconcille it with common opinlon by finding a bridge with it.

- Giving a reasonable interpretation to incomprehensible works often produces excellent works. The reading of BÃ¶hme and Blake, for example.

- Investigate the relation of two things and see how they behave without thelr common property.

- In a time when one gathers ideas and opinions, one ought to maintain a skepticism akin to the New Academy.

-Whenever a thing is to be considered, see how it would look like on a large or small scale.

- Upon finishing the doings of the day, survey the events that have passed since you woke up and ask yourself the following: Where have I sinned? What have l done? What duty have I not performed?
