The purpose of this dialogue is to set a beginner onto a right course of study. Socrates, that famed teacher of Plato, approaches Alcibiades in the beginning of the dialogue. Alcibiades asks why Socrates chose to approach him at that particular moment and not at an earlier time. Socrates promptly answers that he was precluded from doing so by a divine cause. He goes on to speak about all the noble qualities Alcibiades possesses: status, stature, beauty and so forth. But upon finishing his listing, Socrates remarks that even with all of these qualities Alcibiades was still unhappy.  He says that if the young man has any higher goals in mind, he will have to achieve them with his help. The chief goal of Alcibiades is political office and the greatness it affords. When he hears of this goal, Socrates begins to teach Alcibiades by telling him to imagine himself as standing before the Athenian citizenry and then goes on to ask him about what topic he will advise the Athenians. Now, as someone who advises should know better than the one being advised, Socrates has this principle in mind when he asks Alcibiades what subjects he was taught in his youth. The young lad learnt four arts: writing, lyre-playing, wrestling and alous-playing. Socrates then immediately remarks that expertise is what matters in the case of advising someone, not handsomeness or height. Alcibiades quickly replies to this quip by saying he will advise the Athenians on matters of war and peace. An inquiry is then initiated on the meaning of the term "better" and what it would mean in the case where one is tasked with managing the affairs of a nation and its defence. Alcibiades, being particularly witty at this moment, says that the "more just" would be better in such a situation. Socrates, however, perceiving the ambiguity, demands to know the meaning of the term "justice" and how Alcibiades came to learn of it. The young lad answers that he learned it in the same manner that he learnt Greek - by having the general public teach him. However, because the public often disagree on matters of justice, this cannot be so. Alcibiades becomes impatient and charges Socrates with attributing silly views to him. Socrates reminds him that he was merely the questioner and not the respondent. He then proceeds to further question Alcibiades by asking him if an orator could persuade a group of people, wouldn't it be also plausible for the orator to be capable of persuading an individual alone? It is after a few lines of dialogue after this that Socrates makes the explitic argument:
